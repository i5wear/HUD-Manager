HUD Manager makes your screen more satisfying, by providing option of almost every HUD element.

Especially useful when playing in servers that has tons of things on the screen, like MCC Island.

## Feature: All in One

With this single mod, You can manage everything on your screen properly via the mod menu.

You will no longer need to get other stuff like Scoreboard Tweaks and Title Fixer.

**All the configurable HUD elements include:**

Action Bar, Autosave Indicator, Boss Bar, Closed Caption, Crosshair,

Debug Screen, Player List, Scoreboard Sidebar, Screen Title, Status Effect.

*WIP: Chat, Hotbar, Toasts, Screens.*

**All the configurable render states include:**

Show - Determines when to render (Always OFF / Key Hold / Key Toggle / Always ON).

Scale - Multiplies to vanilla GUI scale (0% - 200%, 100% in default).

Offset - Moves the location horizontally and vertically (0 in default).

*WIP: Color - Determines the color and alpha of texts. (0xFFFFFFFF in default).*

## Future Plans

I'm currently working to integrate with the existing vanilla options and keybinds.

Support to other mods, like Inventory HUD+, may also be provided in the future.
