HUD Manager makes your screen satisfying, by providing options of almost every HUD element.

Especially useful when playing in servers with tons of things on the screen, like MCC Island.

## Feature: All in One

With this single mod, You can manage everything on your screen properly via mod menu.

You will no longer need to get other stuff like Scoreboard Tweaks and Title Fixer.

**All the configurable HUD elements include:**

Action Bar, Boss Bar, Closed Caption, Crosshair, Debug Screen, Hotbar Group,

Player List, Scoreboard Sidebar, Screen Title, Status Effect, Toast, Tooltip.

**All the configurable render states include:**

Show - Determines whether to show on screen (OFF/ON, ON in default).

Size - Multiplies to vanilla GUI scale (0% - 200%, 100% in default).

PosX/Y - Adds to vanilla GUI position (-100% - 100%, 0% in default).

## Known Issues

Even though I tried my best to keep tracking and fixing issues by myself,

there are still a few known issues that I'm not going to fix anymore,

because they do not matter, and I'm not a Mojang staff or Fabric/Forge developer.

I'm just taking use of the methods that are intended to work with, and that's it.

**All the known and wont-fix issues include:**

*Debug Pie does not scale and move properly with Debug Screen management.*

*Closed Caption management does not work in 1.21.9 unless the game is paused.*

*Status Bars do not move properly with Hotbar Group management in Fabric.*

*Tooltip management does not work if Shulker Box Tooltip is installed.*
