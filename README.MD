HUD Manager makes your screen more satisfying, by providing option of almost every HUD element.

Especially useful when playing in servers that has tons of things on the screen, like MCC Island.

With this single mod, You can manage everything on your screen properly via the mod menu.

You will no longer need to get other stuff like Scoreboard Tweaks and Title Fixer.

Boss Bar, Closed Caption, Crosshair, Debug Screen, Hotbar Group,

Player List, Scoreboard Sidebar, Screen Title, Status Effect, *(WIP) Toast.*

Size - Multiplies to vanilla GUI scale (0% - 200%, 100% in default).
